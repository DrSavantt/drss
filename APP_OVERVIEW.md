## The Problems It Solves

Marketing agencies today face significant operational challenges that waste time and reduce effectiveness:

### **Tool Fragmentation**
- Marketers typically juggle 10+ different tools: Trello for project management, Google Docs for copy, Dropbox for files, spreadsheets for tracking, email for communication, and more
- Constant context switching between applications
- No unified workflow or single source of truth

### **Scattered Client Information**
- Client data spread across email threads, CRM systems, Google Sheets, and project notes
- Difficult to get a complete picture of any client
- Time spent hunting for basic information like contact details or project status

### **Manual Client Onboarding**
- Repetitive data entry when new clients come onboard
- No standardized way to capture client information and preferences
- Lost opportunities when onboarding friction causes prospects to choose competitors

### **Disconnected Workflows**
- Marketing assets created in isolation from client data
- No integration between research, content creation, and client management
- Difficulty maintaining consistency across projects and clients

### **Lost Productivity**
- Hours wasted each week switching between tools and searching for information
- No unified dashboard showing the full agency operation
- Manual processes that could be automated
