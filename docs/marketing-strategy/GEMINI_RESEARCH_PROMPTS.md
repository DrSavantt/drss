## PROMPT 1: MARKET AWARENESS ANALYSIS

Copy everything below the line and paste into Gemini:

---

I want your help evaluating the level of Market Awareness for a product in the marketing agency services space. The specific product is **a done-for-you productized marketing agency offer — specifically targeting Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical businesses (not in industries that lead people into sin). The offer includes marketing strategy, content creation, copywriting, email sequences, social media content, and sales page copy — all done for them on a flat monthly retainer. Think of it as an outsourced marketing department built around their brand voice and Biblical values.**

I would like for you to dive deep to help me understand the current level of market awareness for this product in **the U.S.**

Here are more details about the market:
- The target demo is Christ-believing men and women, aged 28–55, who own and operate businesses generating $75K–$500K+ in annual revenue.
- These are coaches, consultants, e-commerce sellers, local service providers, course creators, authors, and ministry-adjacent entrepreneurs.
- They specifically do NOT run businesses in industries that lead people into sin (no gambling, adult content, predatory lending, etc.). They see their business as a calling and extension of their faith.
- They are established enough to invest $2K–$7K/month in marketing but are not large enough for a full in-house marketing team.
- They often congregate in faith-based business communities, church business ministries, and online groups for Christian entrepreneurs (e.g., Faith-Driven Entrepreneur, Kingdom Business communities, Marketplace Christians networks).
- Many currently rely on word-of-mouth, DIY marketing, or have been burned by generic agencies that didn't understand their values.

To do this, we can look at the classic levels of Product and Market awareness that is often attributed to Eugene Schwartz, which can be categorized as follows:

1. **Unaware**: Prospects are not even aware of a problem or need that your product or service can solve.
2. **Problem Aware**: Prospects recognize they have a problem or need but are unaware of potential solutions.
3. **Solution Aware**: Prospects know that solutions exist for their problem, but they are not yet aware of your specific solution.
4. **Product Aware**: Prospects know about your solution, your product or service, and are evaluating its features and benefits.
5. **Most Aware**: Prospects are highly aware of your solution, its benefits, and are likely to make a purchase decision soon.

For the intents of this exercise, let's not consider Product Aware or Most Aware to be for our specific product and brand. Instead let's consider it to be an awareness about similar/nearly identical products and brands that offer those products — meaning other marketing agencies, productized services, or done-for-you marketing offers that specifically serve Christian/faith-aligned business owners.

In order to make this assessment please utilize a variety of signals including social media chatter, articles and blog posts, influencer content, search trends, any available sales data on the product category (and its growth), and so on. Specifically look at:
- The growth of the "faith-based business" and "Kingdom business" movement online
- The presence (or lack thereof) of marketing agencies explicitly serving Christian business owners
- Social media discussions in Christian entrepreneur communities about marketing struggles
- Search trends for terms like "Christian marketing agency," "faith-based marketing," "Kingdom business marketing," "marketing for Christian businesses," "values-aligned marketing agency"
- The broader productized agency / done-for-you marketing trend and how it intersects with faith-based business communities
- Podcast, YouTube, and content creator activity in this intersection of faith + marketing

Additionally:

1. Please provide an overview of the estimated TAM (total addressable market) for this product.

2. Please provide a rough estimate of what percentage of the TAM falls into each category of product/market awareness.

3. At the end of your review, please give me a FINAL selection for which stage of Product/Market Awareness the majority of individuals within the market fall.

Thanks!

## PROMPT 2: COMPETITOR RESEARCH

Copy everything below the line and paste into Gemini:

---

I want your help doing competitor research for a product in the marketing agency services / done-for-you marketing space. The specific product is **a productized done-for-you marketing agency offer that provides strategy, content creation, copywriting, email sequences, social content, and sales page copy — specifically for Christ-believing business owners who run ethical, God-honoring businesses (not in industries that lead people into sin).** We are focused on competitors in **the U.S.**

Specifically, we're looking for:
- Marketing agencies that explicitly serve Christian, faith-based, or "Kingdom" business owners
- Productized marketing service providers (flat monthly fee, defined deliverables) targeting small business owners in faith-aligned or values-driven niches
- Freelancers, consultants, or small agencies that position themselves at the intersection of faith and marketing
- Broader productized agency models (not faith-specific) that are successfully serving solopreneurs and small business owners with done-for-you marketing — since these are indirect competitors our audience might consider
- Any coaching programs, courses, or communities teaching Christian business owners to do their own marketing (these are alternative solutions, not direct competitors, but important to understand)

For each competitor you find, I want to understand:

1. Who is the target demo they speak to?
2. What are their main new customer acquisition funnels? (How do they get clients — ads, content, referrals, podcasts, speaking, community, etc.?)
3. What is their core messaging in their ads, website copy, social content, and other marketing assets?
4. What are examples of their advertisements, landing pages, or marketing assets if available?
5. Are there any recurring or repetitive hooks/angles/big ideas you see consistently appearing in their marketing? What language and phrases do they use repeatedly?
6. What is their pricing structure? (Monthly retainer, per-project, tiered packages, etc.)
7. What do customers love and what do customers dislike about them? (Use reviews, testimonials, social signals, social media platforms, forums, etc. to answer this)
8. If available, what is their estimated overall business revenue or scale indicators (team size, client count, years in business)?
9. What are the core promises they make to prospective clients? Value props, language they use when selling their services, etc.? I'm really looking for specific phrases, claims, verbiage used. Basically, if I were selling a done-for-you marketing service to Kingdom business owners, I'd be looking for phrases, sentences, fragments that we see these competitors repeatedly use that I can use or differentiate against.
10. What gaps or weaknesses do you see in how competitors are serving this market? Where is the opportunity for a new entrant to differentiate?

Here are more details about the market:
- Our target clients are Christian business owners (coaches, consultants, e-commerce, service providers, course creators) generating $75K–$500K+ in revenue
- They value integrity, stewardship, and marketing that doesn't use manipulation, false scarcity, or hype
- Many have been burned by generic agencies that didn't understand their faith-driven values
- They congregate in communities like Faith-Driven Entrepreneur, Kingdom Business groups, church business ministries, and Christian entrepreneur networks on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn
- The broader trend of "productized services" (flat fee, defined scope) is growing rapidly — we need to understand how this model is being applied in the faith-based business space specifically

Please go ahead and get started now, and thank you!

## PROMPT 3: PSYCHOGRAPHIC RESEARCH

Copy everything below the line and paste into Gemini:

---

I am writing some sales copy targeted towards **Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical, God-honoring businesses — coaches, consultants, e-commerce sellers, local service providers, course creators, and ministry-adjacent entrepreneurs generating $75K–$500K+ in annual revenue. These are people who see their business as a calling, tithe from their income, serve in their church, and refuse to operate in industries that lead people into sin. They need professional marketing help but struggle with finding solutions that align with their values.**

I'd like your help doing psychographic research. What are their struggles and pain points? What are their beliefs?

Below is a series of questions I used in the past, as part of my RMBC Method for copywriting, where the R stands for research. This should be a good framework to use while doing research on the demo. I'd love it if you can even provide 'quotes' from folks in this demo by looking at comments on social media, in forums, Facebook groups (especially Christian entrepreneur and Kingdom business groups), Reddit threads, podcast discussions, blog comments, etc. Basically we want to hear what they're saying and what they believe. We want to hear answers in their own words!

Here's the list of questions:

**Insights Into Demographic:**

Who Is Your Customer?
(Go deep here — not just demographics but their identity. How do they see themselves? What role does faith play in their business decisions? How do they reconcile business ambition with spiritual conviction?)

What Attitudes Do They Have? (Religious, Political, Social, Economic)?
(These are Christians who take their faith seriously in the marketplace. What does that look like in practice? How does it shape their view of money, marketing, success, and growth?)

What Are Their Hopes and Dreams?
(Beyond just revenue goals — what does the "Kingdom business owner's dream life" look like? What do they want their business to enable for their family, their church, their community, and their legacy?)

What Are Their Victories and Failures?
(What business wins have they experienced? What failures or setbacks have shaped them? What have they tried in marketing specifically that worked or didn't?)

What Outside Forces Do THEY Believe Have Prevented Their Best Life?
(This is crucial — do they blame the secular marketing industry? Do they feel the church hasn't equipped them for business? Do they feel like the online business world is rigged for people willing to compromise? What do THEY point to as the barriers?)

What Are Their Prejudices?
(What assumptions do they make about marketing agencies? About "internet marketers"? About AI? About charging premium prices? About self-promotion? These biases will determine what messaging angles work and which ones will alienate them.)

Sum Up Their Core Beliefs About Life, Love, and Family In 1-3 Sentences.
(Capture the worldview that drives everything — faith, family, stewardship, calling, excellence, integrity.)

**Other Existing Solutions:**

What is the Market Already Using? (List Out)
(DIY social media, Canva, generic agencies, VAs from Fiverr/Upwork, marketing courses, church volunteers, doing nothing, word-of-mouth only, AI tools like ChatGPT, etc.)

What Has Their Experience Been Like?

What Does the Market Like About Existing Solutions?

What Does the Market Dislike About Existing Solutions?

Are There Horror Stories About Existing Solutions?
(Bad agency experiences, wasted money, content that didn't sound like them, marketing that felt manipulative, freelancers who ghosted, etc.)

Does the Market Believe Existing Solutions Work?

If Not, Why?

**Curiosity:**

Has Someone Tried to Solve the Market's Pain Points Before In A Very Unique Way?
(Has anyone created a faith-based marketing agency or system that gained traction? What happened? Are there notable figures in the Kingdom business space who've addressed the marketing problem specifically?)

What Was The Result?

Is There A Conspiratorial Story Behind Why Old Solutions Didn't Work?
(Is there a narrative in this community about WHY the mainstream marketing world doesn't serve them — e.g., "the marketing industry is built on manipulation and deception, which is fundamentally incompatible with how we're called to operate"?)

Are There Any Older Attempts to Solve the Problem That Are Unique?
(Did the early "Christian business" movement try to create its own marketing ecosystem? What happened to early faith-based business networks and their marketing approaches? Were they successful but faded? Were they too "churchy" and not professional enough?)

**Corruption:**

Is There A Belief That the Market's Pain Point Used To Not Exist, Or Used To Not Be So Bad?
(Was there a time when Christian business owners didn't NEED aggressive marketing — when reputation and community were enough? Has the shift to digital/social media created a new problem for faith-based businesses?)

Is There A Belief That It's Been Recently Exacerbated By Outside Forces?
(The rise of "bro marketing," fake gurus, manipulative funnels, algorithm changes that punish organic reach, AI-generated spam flooding the internet, the increasing secularization of online business culture — do they feel like the environment has gotten actively WORSE for honest businesses?)

If So, What Are Those Forces And What's The Reason Behind Their Presence?
(Who or what do they blame? Social media algorithms? The "hustle culture" influencers? The marketing industry's obsession with conversion at all costs? The mainstreaming of deceptive advertising practices online?)

Example framing for this section:
There are isolated communities of Kingdom business owners who thrive through referrals and community trust — they don't need to "market" because their network IS their pipeline. But as the economy shifts online and competition increases, that model breaks down. The outside force is the digital marketplace itself — it rewards those willing to be loud, aggressive, and manipulative, while honest businesses get buried. The question is: can you compete with excellence and integrity, or do you have to compromise to be visible?

Please go ahead and get started now, and thank you!

## PROMPT 4: UNIFIED RESEARCH BRIEF

Run this AFTER you have outputs from Prompts 1, 2, and 3. Upload those PDFs to Gemini and then paste this prompt:

---

I'm working on a marketing campaign in the **done-for-you marketing agency services** space. The product is **a productized marketing agency offer (strategy, content, copy, email, social — all done for them) on a flat monthly retainer, specifically for Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical, God-honoring businesses and refuse to operate in industries that lead people into sin.** We focus on customers in **the U.S.**

So far I have performed research around Product/Market Awareness Levels, Competitors, and Psychographic Research.

I am uploading three PDFs that contain this research. They cover:
1. **Market Awareness Assessment** — Eugene Schwartz awareness levels, TAM analysis, the "Integrity Gap," search trends, community chatter, and the competitive landscape of faith-based marketing services
2. **Competitor Research** — Deep analysis of incumbents (Parable Group, Treefrog Marketing, Luminate Marketing, Red Palm Marketing, Fearless Influence, Him First Media), the education/coaching sector (Spirit-Led Marketing, Hustle with Heart), secular productized benchmarks (DesignJoy model), and the "Blue Ocean" opportunity
3. **Psychographic Research** — RMBC-method deep dive into the Kingdom Entrepreneur avatar, including the Stewardship Paradox, the "Bro Marketing" repulsion, the Sacred-Secular Wound, the Life Surge / MLM traumas, AI anxiety, the Poverty Spirit vs. Prosperity Gospel tension, and the full lexicon of trust

What I want you to do is go through these PDFs in-depth and then create one unified research brief that contains all of the key elements that would be needed in order to successfully implement this campaign. Specifically, this will be a unified document that I will share with you and other LLMs for background information and context as we generate additional copy and marketing assets, most of which will be direct response oriented.

I don't need information on TAM size, or even specific strategies that were included in these deep research reports. Instead what I really need are the following:

**1. Target Market Demographic Overview**
Focus on people who fall into the **Problem Aware** (the majority — ~45% of the market) and **Solution Aware** (~20%) segments. These are:
- **Problem Aware**: Kingdom business owners who feel the pain of stalled growth, DIY marketing burnout, and distrust of secular agencies — but don't yet know that a flat-fee, productized, faith-aligned marketing department exists as an option. They search for symptoms ("how to market a Christian business," "is marketing sinful") not solutions. They default to DIY or doing nothing.
- **Solution Aware**: Those who know marketing agencies exist and have likely looked at options like Treefrog, Fearless Influence, or church-focused agencies — but found them too expensive ($6K+/mo), wrong niche (church/non-profit, not business), or tactically fragmented (SEO-only). They're evaluating but disappointed.

Describe these two segments clearly so a copywriter knows exactly who they're writing to.

**2. Target Market Psychographic Overview**

**What are their problems and pain points?**
Pull from all three research docs. I need this section to be EXHAUSTIVE. Not 5 bullet points — I want 15-25+ dimensionalized pain points that capture the full spectrum of their suffering. Organize them into categories.

Examples of the depth and specificity I'm looking for:
- Feel conflicted between wanting business growth and feeling like marketing requires compromising their testimony and values. They see modern marketing as fundamentally at odds with the "Fruit of the Spirit."
- Burned out from wearing every hat — CEO, marketer, copywriter, content creator, strategist — while also trying to be present for family and ministry. They spiritualize this burnout as "sacrificial service" when it's actually the "Martyr Complex" keeping them trapped.
- View marketing spend through a "Stewardship" lens — every dollar is God's money, so wasting $3K on a bad agency isn't just a business mistake, it's a spiritual failure. This makes them hyper-risk-averse about investing in marketing.
- Have been "burned" by agencies before — either generic secular agencies that used manipulative tactics ("bro marketing"), or "Christian" agencies that hid incompetence behind grace and the Jesus Fish.
- Fear of "sin contamination" — they don't want their email sequences optimized by the same team running a casino's retention strategy. They need to know their marketing partner operates within ethical guardrails.
- Feel like second-class citizens in the Kingdom — the church elevates pastors and missionaries as "holy" while viewing business owners as the "wallets." They crave validation that marketplace work is "Avodah" (worship).
- Struggle to charge what they're worth (especially coaches/consultants) because they unconsciously believe "ministry should be free" — leading to underpricing, thin margins, and resentment.
- Carry specific trauma from predatory faith-based offers (Life Surge seminars, MLM schemes that exploited church networks) that makes them deeply skeptical of any high-ticket offer in the Christian space.
- AI anxiety: they worry that using AI tools makes them "inauthentic" and removes the personal touch that makes their business distinctly Christian.
- Stuck in the "$250K–$300K bottleneck" because they believe no one else can serve their clients with "Christ-like love" — making them incapable of delegating and becoming the single point of failure in their business.

I need ALL the pain points — the operational ones, the emotional ones, the theological ones, the relational ones, and the financial ones.

**What are their hopes and dreams?**
What does their ideal future state look like? Not just "more revenue" — I need the full picture:
- What would their daily life look like? (family time, work hours, stress levels)
- How would they FEEL? (spiritually, emotionally, professionally)
- What would be true about their relationships? (spouse, kids, church community, clients)
- What would their business look like from the outside? (professional presence, consistent growth, team)
- What would their Kingdom impact look like? (generational legacy, ministry funding, marketplace influence)
- Include both the "Tentmaker" dream (business funds the real ministry — family, church, missions) and the "Kingdom Builder" dream (business IS the ministry — marketplace influence, cultural impact, scaling for Kingdom purposes)

**How do they view themselves, and what is the language framework?**
Create TWO clear lists:
- **USE THIS LANGUAGE** — the exact words, phrases, and frameworks that signal "insider" and trigger trust. Pull from the research: Stewardship, Calling/Assignment, Kingdom Impact, Redemptive, Shalom, Marketplace Ministry, Influence, Avodah, Faithful Excellence, "Business as Mission," etc.
- **NEVER USE THIS LANGUAGE** — the exact words, phrases, and frameworks that will instantly kill trust and trigger their traumas. Pull from the research: hustle, crush it, grind, passive income, 6/7/8 figures, guru, hack, funnel hack, limited spots (manufactured), "God told me to tell you," prosperity gospel framing, MLM language, high-pressure closes, fake countdown timers, etc.

**What are the Primary Promises we can make to them?**
I need 15-20+ specific, compelling promises organized by category (operational, emotional, relational, spiritual, financial). Examples:
- Get your entire marketing handled — strategy, content, copy, emails, social — without lifting a finger or compromising your values.
- A flat, predictable monthly investment that aligns with the Stewardship mindset — no opaque billable hours, no "scope creep," no 12-month contracts.
- Marketing that persuades without manipulating — "Redemptive Storytelling" that invites customers into a narrative rather than twisting their arms.
- Finally delegate marketing to someone who shares your values — so you can stop being the bottleneck and focus on the work God actually called you to do.
- Permission to be visible. "Your poverty doesn't help the poor. Your invisibility doesn't serve the Kingdom."

**3. What will their biggest objections be, and how should we address each one?**
Pull from all three research docs. I need at least 10-12 specific objections, organized by category:
- **Trust objections**: "I've been burned before," "Christian agencies are unprofessional," "How do I know you're not just using faith as a marketing angle?"
- **Financial/Stewardship objections**: "I can't justify $2K/month," "What if it doesn't work and I've wasted God's money?"
- **Theological objections**: "Is marketing even biblical?", "Won't this make me look worldly?", "What about AI — is that authentic?"
- **Operational objections**: "Can you really capture MY voice?", "What if my industry is too niche?", "I've tried outsourcing before and the quality was terrible"
- **Trauma-based objections**: "This feels like another high-ticket pitch (Life Surge)," "Is this an MLM?", "Why should I trust another 'guru'?"

For EACH objection, provide a specific counter-response that uses THEIR language and addresses THEIR specific theological/emotional concern — not generic sales objection handling.

**4. What existing solutions has the market tried already? Why does each one fail for THIS audience specifically?**
Pull from the competitor research. I need each solution listed with:
- What it is
- Why they tried it
- Why it failed or fell short FOR THIS SPECIFIC AUDIENCE (not generic reasons — faith-specific reasons)
- What emotional residue it left behind (what trauma or skepticism does this create that we need to address?)

Solutions to cover at minimum:
- DIY marketing (the default)
- Generic secular agencies
- Christian agencies (Treefrog, Fearless Influence, Him First, etc. — too expensive, church-focused, fragmented, incompetent)
- Freelancers and VAs (Fiverr, Upwork)
- Marketing courses and coaching (Spirit-Led Marketing, etc.)
- AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.)
- Word-of-mouth / doing nothing
- Church volunteers helping with marketing
- The "Fractional CMO" model (too expensive for the $75K-$300K range)

Your goal with all of this is to create one comprehensive, well-organized document that I can hand to any AI (or human copywriter) and they'd have everything they need to write compelling direct response copy for this offer targeting this specific audience. The document should be DENSE with usable material — specific language, specific pain points, specific promises, specific objections with specific counters. Not high-level summaries — give me the raw material a copywriter can pull directly into headlines, bullets, email sequences, and VSL scripts.

Thank you!

## PROMPT 5: UNIQUE MECHANISM IDEATION (UMP + UMS)

Upload your Unified Research Brief PDF to Gemini, then paste this prompt:

---

Today I want your help coming up with as many Unique Mechanism ideas as possible for a product in the done-for-you marketing agency services space. The specific product is **a productized marketing agency offer — strategy, content creation, copywriting, email sequences, social media content, and sales page copy — all done for them on a flat monthly retainer, specifically built for Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical, God-honoring businesses (not in industries that lead people into sin). Think of it as a full outsourced marketing department that shares their Biblical values.**

I have attached a research brief that will help you understand the market we are speaking to.

Here is a quick overview of how to understand Unique Mechanisms in the world of direct response and D2C copy:

**In a Nutshell:**
The unique mechanism explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal... and how they can overcome that problem. At its core, the unique mechanism is always a two-part logical connection.

**The Reason It's Important:**
Typically by the time our prospect comes to us, they've tried numerous solutions to their problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, worked partially, or worked fully for a period of time (before they stopped working).

Our job as a copywriter is to educate our prospect about the REAL reason why past solutions didn't bring them permanent results. We do this by explaining that their knowledge about the problem is incomplete. They've been missing ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, and this "knowledge gap" is what's been holding them back.

There are two parts to the unique mechanism:

1. **Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem (UMP)** our Prospect Faces.
2. **Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution (UMS)** to that Problem.

It's important to identify the unique mechanism behind both the problem AND the solution.

By showing the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why they've failed in the past.

By showing the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR THIS EXERCISE:**

One thing to pay VERY careful attention to is the levels of Product/Market Awareness we are focusing on. This is important, because the UMP and UMS need to speak to our prospects where they are at. In other words, if the main market segment we are targeting is Problem Aware, it wouldn't make sense to have the UMP/UMS speak to people who are Product Aware or Most Aware.

**For this exercise, let's specifically focus on people in the market who are Problem Aware.**

These are Kingdom business owners who:
- KNOW they have a marketing problem (stalled growth, inconsistency, DIY burnout, overwhelm)
- Have tried solutions before that failed (DIY, maybe a freelancer, maybe a generic agency, maybe a course they never finished)
- Do NOT yet know that a "productized, flat-fee, faith-aligned outsourced marketing department" exists as a category
- Feel paralyzed by the "Integrity Gap" — stuck between "professional but secular" (risky values) and "Christian but amateur" (risky results)
- View their business capital as God's money (Stewardship mindset), making every marketing investment feel spiritually weighted
- Are repulsed by "bro marketing" — false scarcity, manipulation, high-pressure tactics — but don't see an alternative path to growth
- Default to DIY because they don't trust anyone else to handle their "voice" or understand their values

When generating UMP/UMS ideas, think about:
- Why have their past marketing efforts (DIY, agencies, freelancers, courses, AI tools) all failed to produce lasting results? What's the REAL underlying reason they don't know about?
- What "knowledge gap" has kept them stuck — doing everything themselves, burning out, staying invisible?
- What is the hidden mechanism behind their problem that, once revealed, makes them go "THAT'S why nothing has worked"?
- And then: what is the mechanism behind OUR solution that makes them believe "THIS is different — this will actually work for me"?

Consider mechanisms rooted in:
- The theological/spiritual dimension (stewardship, calling, the sacred-secular divide)
- The operational dimension (why DIY and fragmented solutions always break down)
- The trust/values dimension (why secular agencies and "Christian" agencies both fail them)
- The systemic dimension (what's structurally wrong with how they've approached marketing)
- The identity dimension (how their self-perception as "stewards" rather than "owners" creates specific blind spots)

Please generate as many UMP/UMS pairs as possible. For each one, provide:
1. A clear, compelling name for the mechanism
2. The UMP (why they've been failing / what they didn't know about the problem)
3. The UMS (how our solution uniquely fixes this / what makes us different)
4. A brief note on why this mechanism would resonate with a Problem Aware Kingdom business owner

Please go ahead and get started now.

## PROMPT 6: UNIQUE MECHANISM RANKING

Upload BOTH your Unified Research Brief PDF AND the UMP/UMS Ideation output (from Prompt 5) to Gemini, then paste this prompt:

---

I am working on some direct response sales copy that will sell **a productized done-for-you marketing agency service (strategy, content, copy, email, social — flat monthly retainer) specifically for Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical, God-honoring businesses.**

I'm sharing two documents with you:

1. **The Unified Research Brief** — Contains relevant information about the market we're selling to, including the level of Product/Market Awareness we'll be speaking to, competitor analysis, and key psychographic information.

2. **The Unique Mechanism Ideation Document** — Contains several unique mechanism ideas (UMP/UMS pairs) that could be used in our sales copy when selling our service to the market.

Here's a reminder of what a Unique Mechanism is and why it's important in direct response and DTC marketing:

**In a Nutshell:**
The unique mechanism explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal... and how they can overcome that problem. At its core, the unique mechanism is always a two-part logical connection.

**The Reason It's Important:**
Typically by the time our prospect comes to us, they've tried numerous solutions to their problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, worked partially, or worked fully for a period of time (before they stopped working).

Our job as a copywriter is to educate our prospect about the REAL reason why past solutions didn't bring them permanent results. We do this by explaining that their knowledge about the problem is incomplete. They've been missing ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, and this "knowledge gap" is what's been holding them back.

There are two parts to the unique mechanism:

1. **Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem (UMP)** our Prospect Faces.
2. **Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution (UMS)** to that Problem.

It's important to identify the unique mechanism behind both the problem AND the solution.

By showing the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why they've failed in the past.

By showing the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed.

---

**Here's what I want you to do:**

Evaluate each unique mechanism idea based on their potential for connecting to our target market and persuading them to buy the service we are selling, and rank them from most likely to succeed to least likely to succeed.

In order to make this evaluation, consider the Unified Research Brief and the beliefs, attitudes, awareness levels, and competitive environment within which our target customer finds themselves.

**When making your rankings, keep in mind that our core market is people who are Problem Aware.**

These are Kingdom business owners ($75K–$500K revenue) who:
- Feel the pain of stalled growth, DIY burnout, and marketing overwhelm
- Have been "burned" by past solutions (generic agencies, freelancers, courses they never finished)
- View marketing spend through a "Stewardship" lens (every dollar is God's money)
- Are repulsed by "bro marketing" but don't see an ethical alternative
- Are paralyzed by the "Integrity Gap" — stuck between secular competence and Christian values alignment
- Default to DIY or doing nothing because they don't trust anyone else with their brand voice and values
- Do NOT yet know that a productized, flat-fee, faith-aligned marketing department exists as a solution

For each mechanism, evaluate it on these criteria:
1. **Emotional resonance** — Does this hit a nerve the prospect FEELS daily? Does it tap into their specific theological and operational pain?
2. **Knowledge gap credibility** — Is the "missing piece of information" believable and genuinely new to them? Or will they feel like they already know this?
3. **Problem-Solution bridge strength** — Does the UMP naturally and logically lead to our specific UMS? Does it create a "of course THAT'S the answer" moment?
4. **Differentiation power** — Does this mechanism clearly separate us from every other option they've tried or considered (DIY, generic agencies, Christian agencies, courses, AI tools)?
5. **Theological/spiritual alignment** — Does this mechanism work WITH their worldview (stewardship, calling, integrity) rather than against it? Will it feel "safe" and "aligned" to a Kingdom business owner?
6. **Copywriting potential** — Can this mechanism be turned into compelling headlines, hooks, email subjects, VSL leads, and story-driven content? Is it vivid and concrete, or abstract and hard to dramatize?

After ranking, provide:
- Your **Top 3** mechanisms with a detailed explanation of why each one would be the strongest lead for copy
- For each Top 3, suggest a **headline or hook** that demonstrates how the mechanism would open a piece of sales copy
- Any recommendations for **combining or hybridizing** mechanisms if you see two that are stronger together than apart

Please go ahead and do this now.

## PROMPT 7: THE RMBC ENHANCED BRIEF

This is the keystone prompt — it builds the final blueprint that all copy will be written from. Upload ALL of the following PDFs to Gemini:

I am building the complete RMBC Enhanced Brief for a direct response marketing campaign. This brief will be the master blueprint that I (and other LLMs) will use to write ALL copy assets — VSL scripts, email sequences, ad copy, landing pages, advertorials, and social content.

**The Product:** A productized done-for-you marketing agency service — strategy, content creation, copywriting, email sequences, social media content, and sales page copy — all delivered on a flat monthly retainer. Built specifically for Christ-believing business owners in the U.S. who run ethical, God-honoring businesses (not in industries that lead people into sin). Think of it as a full outsourced marketing department that shares their Biblical values.

**The Market:** Kingdom business owners ($75K–$500K revenue) who are primarily **Problem Aware** — they know they have a marketing problem but don't yet know that a productized, flat-fee, faith-aligned marketing department exists.

I am uploading three documents:
1. **Unified Research Brief** — Contains the full demographic/psychographic profile, pain points, promises, objections, language framework, and existing solution analysis
2. **Unique Mechanism Ideation** — Contains 16 UMP/UMS mechanism pairs developed for this market
3. **Unique Mechanism Ranking** — Contains the evaluated ranking of all mechanisms with the Top 3 identified as: (1) The Toil Confusion, (2) The Buried Talent Trap, (3) The Invisible City Problem, plus two hybrid recommendations

Using all of this material, build me a complete RMBC Enhanced Brief that covers every section below. **Do NOT summarize or abbreviate.** Each section should be thorough enough that a copywriter or LLM could write a complete piece of copy from that section alone.

---

### SECTION 1: TARGET AUDIENCE

**1A. Who is the prospect?**
Provide a vivid, dimensionalized portrait — not just demographics. Include:
- Demographics (age, gender, revenue, business type, geography)
- Psychographics (identity, worldview, theological framework, self-perception)
- Their "operating system" — how they make decisions (Stewardship mindset, the "Divine ROI" burden, risk aversion around God's money)
- The two sub-avatars: the "Tentmaker" (business funds ministry) vs. the "Kingdom Builder" (business IS ministry) — and how to speak to both

**1B. What are their pain points?**
I need an EXHAUSTIVE inventory. Pull from the Unified Research Brief and organize into categories:
- Theological/Spiritual pain (Stewardship Paradox, Sacred-Secular Wound, Validation Starvation, AI anxiety, fear of sin contamination)
- Operational/Financial pain (Martyr Complex burnout, $250K bottleneck, Poverty Spirit, Black Box fear, Social Media drudgery, Decision Paralysis)
- Trauma/Emotional pain (Bro Marketing repulsion, Life Surge trauma, MLM stigma, Christian Quality Paradox, "burned" by agencies)
- Relational pain (family tension, isolation, spouse conflict, church community judgment)

For each pain point, provide:
- A description of the pain
- How it manifests in their daily life
- What they SAY about it (in their own words — pull from the research)
- What they FEEL about it (the deeper emotion beneath the surface complaint)

**1C. What are their desires?**
Not just "more revenue" — the full picture:
- The "Kingdom Builder" dream (scale for influence, cultural impact, finance the Kingdom)
- The "Tentmaker" dream (efficient business that funds family, church, missions without consuming their life)
- Daily life transformation (hours, stress, presence with family)
- Emotional transformation (confidence, peace, pride in their work, resolved inner conflict)
- Relational transformation (spouse, kids, church community, clients)
- Spiritual transformation (marketing as worship, business as Avodah, stewardship fulfilled)
- Legacy transformation (generational wisdom transfer, not just money)

---

### SECTION 2: THE BIG PROMISE

**2A. The Promise of the Copy**
What will the prospect LEARN from engaging with our marketing content (VSL, email, ad)? This is the "hook promise" — the reason they keep reading/watching. What new information or revelation will they walk away with?

Write this as a clear, compelling statement. Example format: "Discover the hidden reason why Kingdom business owners stay invisible — and the Biblical principle that, once understood, lets you grow without compromising your testimony."

**2B. The Promise of the Product**
What will the prospect GET from purchasing the service? This is the transformation promise. What does their life/business look like after they become a client?

Write this as a clear, compelling statement. Example format: "A full marketing department that shares your values — strategy, copy, content, email, social — delivered monthly for a flat fee. So you can stop wearing every hat and start focusing on the work God actually called you to do."

---

### SECTION 3: EXISTING SOLUTIONS & WHY THEY FAIL

For each existing solution the market has tried, provide:
- What it is
- Why they tried it
- The specific reason it failed FOR THIS AUDIENCE (not generic — faith-specific)
- The emotional residue it left behind

Cover at minimum:
1. DIY marketing (the default)
2. Generic secular agencies
3. High-end Christian agencies (Treefrog — too expensive, won't execute)
4. Church-focused agencies (Luminate — wrong skillset, too soft)
5. Tactical specialists (Him First, Fearless Influence — fragmented, commoditized)
6. Secular productized services (DesignJoy — Integrity Gap, sin contamination fear)
7. Marketing courses/coaching (Spirit-Led Marketing — adds to the to-do list)
8. Freelancers/VAs (Fiverr, Upwork, Belay — transactional, no strategy, unequally yoked)
9. AI tools (ChatGPT — inauthentic, no strategy, no voice capture)
10. Word-of-mouth / doing nothing (plateaued, feast-or-famine)
11. Fractional CMO model (too expensive for $75K–$300K range)

---

### SECTION 4: THE UNIQUE MECHANISM

**4A. The Primary Mechanism: The "Toil Confusion"**
Write this section as if you are explaining the mechanism to a copywriter who needs to write a full VSL section about it. Include:
- The UMP (Unique Mechanism behind the Problem): Why they've been stuck — they've confused "toil" (the curse of Genesis 3) with "work" (the command of Colossians 3:23). They've been spiritualizing their burnout as faithfulness when it's actually evidence they're operating under the curse, not the calling.
- The UMS (Unique Mechanism behind the Solution): How our service breaks the curse — by providing a systematized, values-aligned execution partner that transforms marketing from "toil" (the owner grinding alone) into "stewardship" (resources deployed through a trusted system).
- Mechanism nicknames that can be used to tease the solution in copy (e.g., "The Genesis 2 Marketing Method," "The Toil-to-Stewardship Shift," "The Kingdom Marketing Engine")

**4B. Supporting Mechanism: The "Buried Talent Trap"**
Same depth as above. The UMP reframes "saving money by not investing in marketing" as "burying the talent" — a direct violation of the Stewardship mandate. The UMS shows that our flat-fee model is the MULTIPLICATION of the talent — predictable investment that compounds into visibility, leads, and Kingdom impact.

**4C. Supporting Mechanism: The "Invisible City Problem"**
Same depth as above. The UMP reframes "staying humble and small" as "putting your city under a bushel" — the opposite of the Matthew 5:14 mandate. The UMS positions our service as the infrastructure that puts their city ON the hill — professional marketing that makes their excellence visible to the people God called them to serve.

**4D. The Hybrid Mega-Mechanism: "The Stewardship of Visibility"**
Combine elements of the Buried Talent Trap and the Invisible City Problem into one unified narrative: "You are burying the talent (capital) by refusing to be a city on a hill (visibility). True stewardship is using your resources to ensure the people God called you to serve can actually find you." Write this as a cohesive mechanism narrative a copywriter can use as the "big idea" of a VSL or long-form sales page.

---

### SECTION 5: CURIOSITY QUESTIONS

Generate 10-15 practical curiosity questions that could be used in copy to build intrigue. These should hint at the mechanism without revealing it. Examples:
- "What does Genesis 2 reveal about the REAL reason your marketing feels like an endless grind?"
- "Why the most 'faithful' thing you can do for your business might look nothing like what your pastor taught you about humility?"

---

### SECTION 6: METAPHORS & ANALOGIES

Generate 8-10 metaphors or analogies that simplify the core concepts for this audience. These should use Biblical or faith-familiar imagery. Examples:
- "Your marketing should be a storehouse (Joseph), not a sacrifice (Cain)"
- "We're the Jethro to your Moses — handling the systems so you can focus on the calling"

---

### SECTION 7: BOLD CLAIMS

Generate 8-10 bold, specific claims about the service that can be used in copy. These must be believable to a skeptical Kingdom business owner. Examples:
- "Reclaim 10-15 hours per week you're currently losing to DIY marketing"
- "Every piece of content passes through Kingdom Guardrails — no manipulation, no false scarcity, no compromise"

---

### SECTION 8: FUTURE PACING

Describe what the prospect's life looks like AFTER they become a client, across four dimensions:

**Physical/Tangible Benefits:**
What changes in their business that they can see and measure? (Revenue, hours, content output, lead flow, etc.)

**Emotional Benefits:**
What changes in how they FEEL? (Peace, confidence, pride, resolved guilt, freedom from the grind)

**Social Benefits:**
What changes in their relationships and community standing? (Spouse, family, church community, clients, peers)

**Spiritual/Psychological Benefits:**
What changes in their inner world? (Stewardship fulfilled, marketing as worship, the sacred-secular divide healed, calling validated)

Write each dimension with vivid, specific scenarios — not abstract promises. Paint pictures they can SEE themselves in.

---

### SECTION 9: CREDIBILITY & TRUST BUILDERS

**9A. Speaker/Brand Positioning**
How should the brand/founder be positioned in copy? What credentials, story, and identity should be emphasized? (Not a pastor who dabbles in marketing. Not a marketer who adds a Bible verse. A Kingdom-minded strategist operating at the intersection of faith, excellence, and modern marketing systems.)

**9B. The Origin Story (Narrative Arc)**
Outline the founder's story as it should appear in copy. Include:
- The "before" (frustrated by the manipulative marketing industry)
- The turning point (decided to build a system that proves clean marketing can compete)
- The "discovery" (built the system, tested it, saw it work)
- The mission (realized thousands of Kingdom business owners are invisible because they refuse to market like the world — and they shouldn't have to)

**9C. Testimonials & Social Proof**
What types of testimonials and proof should be developed? What would the IDEAL testimonial say? Write 3-5 "aspirational testimonials" that represent what early clients would say if the service delivers as promised. (These serve as targets for collecting real testimonials.)

**9D. External Validation**
What third-party credibility can be referenced? (Proven frameworks: RMBC, AIDA, PAS, StoryBrand. AI technology. The "productized service" model validated by DesignJoy. The "Business as Mission" movement. C12/Convene peer groups.)

---

### SECTION 10: PRACTICAL CONVERSION ELEMENTS

**10A. Pricing Structure**
- Normal perceived value (what a full-time marketing hire or traditional agency costs: $4K–$8K/month)
- Our pricing tiers and what's included at each level
- The "Stewardship" framing — predictable, transparent, no billable-hour creep

**10B. Guarantee**
- Write the guarantee using their language (Stewardship, integrity, no games)
- Must radically distance from "Life Surge" type guarantees — no hype, no pressure

**10C. Bonuses**
- What bonuses would add genuine value and lower perceived risk?
- Suggestions: Brand Voice Bible, 90-Day Marketing Roadmap, Strategy Call, Marketing Integrity Audit

**10D. Scarcity (Ethical/Real)**
- Capacity-based scarcity only (true — you can only serve X clients per quarter)
- Application model framing
- "Results compound over time" urgency (every month without a system = missed compounding)

**10E. Objection Handling**
Pull the full objection inventory from the Unified Research Brief. For each objection, provide:
- The objection in their words
- The underlying fear/trauma driving it
- The counter-response using THEIR language and theological framework
- A one-line "reframe" that could appear in copy

---

### SECTION 11: HOOKS & HEADLINE IDEAS

Generate 15-20 hook/headline concepts organized by mechanism:

**Toil Confusion hooks:**
(Headlines that challenge the burnout-as-faithfulness narrative)

**Buried Talent Trap hooks:**
(Headlines that reframe marketing investment as stewardship obedience)

**Invisible City hooks:**
(Headlines that challenge false humility and reframe visibility as mandate)

**Hybrid "Stewardship of Visibility" hooks:**
(Headlines combining the financial and moral dimensions)

**General problem-agitation hooks:**
(Headlines that speak to the raw pain without revealing the mechanism)

For each hook, note whether it would work best as: a VSL opening, an email subject line, an ad headline, or a social media post.

---

### SECTION 12: POTENTIAL UPSELLS & ASCENSION

What would the natural "next step" offers be for clients who want more? Think about:
- Strategy intensives or VIP days
- Launch support packages
- Sales funnel buildouts
- Ongoing optimization retainers
- Referral/affiliate incentives

---

This brief should be the SINGLE DOCUMENT that any copywriter — human or AI — needs to write any piece of marketing for this offer. Make it exhaustive. Make it specific. Make it usable.

Thank you!

**Pro tips:**
- Run Prompt 5 in both Gemini (Deep Research mode) and Claude for maximum mechanism variety. Then feed ALL mechanism outputs into Prompt 6 for ranking.
- Run Prompt 6 across multiple LLMs (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) — if all three rank the same mechanism #1, you have high confidence.
- Prompt 7 (the Enhanced Brief) is the crown jewel. Run it in Gemini 2.5 Pro for maximum output length. This document becomes the single source of truth for ALL copy production.
- For Phase 4 (Copy), you'll upload the Enhanced Brief and ask for specific assets. The brief should be rich enough that any LLM can produce on-target copy without additional context.
